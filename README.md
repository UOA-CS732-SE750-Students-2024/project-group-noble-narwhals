# Dev Notes (look before you start working on the project):
## Git Workflow:
- Please use the `develop` branch for development work.
- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you work on. Name as `feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/your-bug-name`.
- When you are ready to merge your changes, create a pull request from your feature branch to the `develop` branch.
- Please use the project board to keep track of your work and progress.
## Frontend:
### For the file structure, please follow the rules bellow.
- Every page file should be in the `pages` folder.
- Every component file should be in the `components` folder.
- IF a component have sub-components, please create a folder for it and put the sub-components in it.
- For the hooks, please put them in the `hooks` folder.
### For the style
- Please use variables for colors, etc in the `tailwind.config.js` file.
